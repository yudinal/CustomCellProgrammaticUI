# Pursuit-Core-iOS-CustomCells

Use the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to load a list of people into a Collection View.  Clicking on a user should segue to a detail View Controller that displays more information about the user.

The project file includes the model and necessary networking classes for hitting the API.  Focus on desining and building the UI programmatically.  You may either use a xib file or define your cells fully programmatically.
